Hey! I'm Lindalva Ngazane, a Computer Engineering student with a big passion for programming! ðŸ’»âœ¨

In my free time, I love creating e-books â€” it's my way of mixing creativity, knowledge, and inspiration.

I'm always learning new languages like C++, Java, Python, and Lua. Iâ€™m fully dedicated to mobile development with Flutter and Dart, and also work with web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

Beyond the world of code, I dive into graphic design and UI/UX, using Canva, Photoshop, and Figma to build beautiful and meaningful visual experiences. ðŸŽ¨ðŸ’¡

My biggest dream is to inspire girls and show the world that tech is for those who have courage, creativity, and the will to make things happen! Letâ€™s go together? ðŸ’ªðŸš€
